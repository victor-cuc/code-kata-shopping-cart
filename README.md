## Thought process

First I created a map to store the count of each item.

The program iterates through the input, letter by letter, looks for the item in the map, and either increments the count or creates a new entry with count 0.

Then, for each entry it calculates the final price after discount and then adds it to the total.

Finally, the total is printed and the program ends.

I know that the program could have been less hard-coded but I wanted to be as quick as I could.

## How to run

To run the file, run Checkout with the letters as arguments **divided by whitespace**

*For example, "java Checkout A A B C"*
